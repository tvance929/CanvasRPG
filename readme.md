# CanvasRPG

Welcome to CanvasRPG.  This game is in it's infancy.  Feel free to make suggestions and/or run with the concept!

##Concept

I love the old school (80's - early 90's) RPG's  (Ultima's, Wizadry, Betrayal At Krondor, Bard's Tale, etc.) ... and I would love to make one IN the Canvas tag using only key/value pairs on the clients side for the saving of the game and game info.

That's about it... now go.
